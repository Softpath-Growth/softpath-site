Timeblock is a time tracking and task management app built as an alternative to Reclaim.

I liked Reclaim's core concept but wanted specific features and workflows it didn't support. So I built my own version with the flexibility to add exactly what I needed.

Track time blocks, manage tasks, and adjust your schedule as reality diverges from the plan. No rigid productivity frameworks. No features you'll never use. Just the scheduling and tracking functionality that matters, implemented the way you actually want it to work.

Built for people who've tried off-the-shelf productivity tools and found themselves working around their limitations instead of with them.
