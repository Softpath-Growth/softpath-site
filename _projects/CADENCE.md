CADENCE is an A/B testing platform designed around test velocity and business outcomes, not statistical theater.

Traditional experimentation platforms optimize for rigor at the expense of speed. CADENCE inverts that: ship experiments quickly, measure what actually matters (revenue, retention, activation), and get clear calls on whether to ship or kill.

Built for product and growth teams who've realized that running fewer "perfect" tests means learning slower than the market moves. Integrates with your existing analytics stack and doesn't require data science approval to launch a test.

Currently in closed beta. If you're running 10+ experiments per quarter and your current tooling is slowing you down, we should talk.
