DailyHabit is a suite of embeddable word games (Wordle-style, crosswords, anagrams) designed specifically to increase DAU and retention in SaaS products.

The insight: people build habits around things they do daily. If your product isn't naturally a daily-use product, adding a simple daily game can create the habit loop you need for stickiness.

Each game is lightweight, embeddable via iframe or JavaScript, and can be white-labeled to match your product's branding. Analytics included so you can measure impact on retention and activation metrics.

Built for product teams at SaaS companies who've seen Duolingo's retention numbers and wondered if the same mechanics could work for their product. (They can, if implemented correctly.)

Currently in private beta. Interested in testing with your product? Get in touch.
