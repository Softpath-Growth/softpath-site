### Hero Section

**Headline:**
I fix marketing infrastructure and run paid acquisition you can actually measure.

**Subhead:**
I'm Noah. I help B2C and B2B2C companies connect their ad spend to real business outcomes, not platform vanity metrics.

**Body:**
Most growth teams are flying blind. Tracking is broken, tools don't talk to each other, and nobody trusts the numbers. I fix that, then help you scale paid acquisition with confidence.

### What I Do Section

**Martech & Tracking**
Your tools should work together. I audit, fix, and implement the infrastructure that connects your marketing stack to real data.

**Paid Acquisition**
Meta, Google, TikTok. I manage campaigns optimized to actual customer value, not in-platform ROAS.

**Marketing Analytics**
From attribution to LTV modeling, I build the measurement systems that tell you what's actually working.

## About Page (/about/)

# About

I'm Noah. I started Softpath to help growth teams stop guessing and start measuring.

I've spent 13+ years in performance marketing, analytics, and marketing automation. I've managed paid acquisition from $1K/month to $1M/month across Meta, Google, and TikTok. I've implemented and configured tools like Segment, Klaviyo, HubSpot, ActiveCampaign, GA4, and GTM for companies at every stage.

What I've learned: most marketing teams have decent instincts but terrible infrastructure. They're making decisions based on data they can't trust, using tools that don't talk to each other, and optimizing to metrics that don't matter.

My approach is practical. I focus on what actually drives results: clean tracking, connected systems, and paid acquisition tied to real customer value.

I work primarily with B2C and B2B2C companies, ecommerce brands, subscription businesses, and marketplaces. If you're running paid acquisition and want to actually know what's working, we should talk.

## Marketing Infrastructure Audit

Before you scale spend or buy another tool, find out if your current setup is telling you the truth.

In 2-3 weeks, I'll audit your tracking, martech stack, and paid accounts, then give you a prioritized roadmap to fix what's broken.

**What's included:**

**Tracking & Attribution Assessment**
- Pixel and tag implementation review (Meta, Google, TikTok, GA4, GTM)
- Event taxonomy and conversion tracking validation
- Attribution gap analysis
- Cross-platform data consistency check

**Martech Stack Assessment**
- Tool inventory: what you have, what you're paying, what's actually used
- Data flow mapping: how data moves between systems (or doesn't)
- Configuration review for core platforms (Segment, Klaviyo, HubSpot, ActiveCampaign)
- Recommendations: keep, fix, consolidate, or kill

**Paid Acquisition Audit**
- Account structure evaluation across active platforms
- Spend efficiency analysis (90-day or 6-month window depending on sales cycle)
- Creative and audience organization review
- Measurement validation: do platform numbers match reality?

**What you get:**
- Written report with findings and supporting data
- Slide deck for stakeholders
- Live walkthrough call to review findings and discuss next steps
- Prioritized 90-day action plan

---

## Martech Implementation

After the audit, I can implement the fixes: tracking setup, tool configuration, data flow fixes, and integrations.

**Tools I work with:**
- Segment
- GA4 / GTM
- Klaviyo
- HubSpot
- ActiveCampaign
- Attio

---

## Paid Acquisition Management

I manage paid campaigns across Meta, Google, and TikTok, optimized to real business metrics, not platform ROAS.

**What makes this different:**
- Campaigns tied to actual CAC, LTV, and payback period
- Reporting that connects ad spend to revenue
- Structure and creative testing that compounds over time

I work on a retainer basis with companies who have completed the infrastructure audit or already have solid measurement in place.

---

## Marketing Analytics & LTV Modeling

For companies ready to go deeper, I build cohort analysis, LTV projections, and unit economics models that inform acquisition strategy.

This isn't a dashboard project. It's the analytical backbone that tells you which customers are worth acquiring and how much you should pay to get them.

---

## How Engagements Work

**Start here:** Most engagements begin with the Marketing Infrastructure Audit. It's the fastest way to understand what's broken and what to prioritize.

**From there:** You can execute fixes internally, engage me for implementation, or move into ongoing paid management.

**Pricing:** I work on a time and materials basis. Scope and pricing are discussed after an initial call.
