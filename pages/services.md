# We fix marketing infrastructure and run acquisition you can actually measure.

Most growth problems are measurement problems in disguise. You can't optimize what you can't measure, and you can't trust decisions based on data you know is wrong.

Three interconnected areas: getting your tracking and tools working correctly, running paid acquisition tied to real business outcomes, and building analytics systems that tell you what's actually happening.

<h2 id="infrastructure-audits"><i class="ph ph-wrench service-heading-icon"></i>Marketing Infrastructure Audits</h2>

**We audit your stack, then fix what's broken.**

The audit is a 2-3 week diagnostic covering your tracking implementation, martech architecture, and paid acquisition setup. From there, we handle implementation directly.

**What we examine:** Event tracking accuracy and completeness across web and app. Data flow between marketing tools, CRM, and analytics platforms. Pixel health and conversion API implementation. Attribution configuration and its alignment with how your business actually works.

**What we fix:** Event tracking across web, mobile, and server-side. CDP configuration and optimization (Segment, Rudderstack, others). GA4 setup including the parts Google makes unnecessarily complicated. Conversion APIs for Meta, Google, and TikTok. Integrations connecting marketing data to your CRM and business systems.

**What you get:** A findings document identifying what's broken, misconfigured, or missing. Prioritized recommendations ranked by impact and effort. And if you bring us in for implementation, tracking you can trust.

The audit pays for itself. Every client we've audited has discovered tracking gaps, measurement errors, or wasted spend they didn't know existed.

<h2 id="paid-acquisition"><i class="ph ph-target service-heading-icon"></i>Paid Acquisition Management</h2>

**Campaigns optimized to business outcomes, not platform metrics.**

We manage paid acquisition across Meta, Google, and TikTok for B2C and B2B2C companies. The difference: we optimize to actual customer value, not in-platform ROAS.

Platform metrics lie. They over-attribute, double-count, and are increasingly modeled rather than measured. We build measurement systems that show true acquisition cost and customer value, then use that data to make real optimization decisions.

**What we manage:** Full-funnel Meta campaigns from prospecting through retargeting. Google Ads including Search, Shopping, Performance Max, and YouTube. TikTok for brands where the audience and creative fit. Creative strategy and iteration based on actual performance data.

**How we approach it:** Fix measurement first so we know what's working. Structure campaigns for incrementality testing, not efficiency theater. Focus on contribution margin and LTV, not vanity ROAS. Communicate in business terms, not ad platform jargon.

Monthly spend from $1K to $1M+. Agnostic on budget size, selective on fit.

<h2 id="analytics-consulting"><i class="ph ph-chart-line-up service-heading-icon"></i>Analytics & Measurement Consulting</h2>

**Dashboards people trust. Metrics that drive decisions.**

Analytics implementations fail for two reasons: the underlying data is wrong, or the reporting doesn't answer the questions people actually have. We fix both.

**What we build:** Attribution models that reflect how your business actually acquires customers, not how platforms want to take credit. LTV and cohort analyses that inform acquisition efficiency decisions. Executive dashboards that answer "how are we doing" without requiring a data team to interpret. Marketing mix models for companies with enough scale and channel diversity.

**What we use:** Looker, Metabase, or whatever BI tool you already have. Spreadsheets if that makes sense for your stage. The tool matters less than the thinking behind it.

**What we don't do:** We're not a data warehouse shop. If you need a full modern data stack from scratch, we can advise on architecture and recommend specialists. We operate at the analytics and measurement layer, assuming reasonably clean data exists or can be created.

<h2 id="engagements">How engagements typically work</h2>

**Infrastructure Audit:** 2-3 weeks, fixed scope. The diagnostic that tells you what's broken and what to fix first. Often leads to implementation work, but no obligation.

**Implementation Projects:** Scope and timeline vary by complexity. Tracking overhauls typically run 4-8 weeks. Martech integrations depend on the systems involved. We scope tightly and communicate constantly.

**Ongoing Retainers:** For paid acquisition management and continuous analytics support. Monthly commitment, typically 20-40 hours depending on channel complexity and spend level. Scales up or down as needs change.

**Pricing:** Time and materials, always. We estimate ranges upfront, but project-based pricing doesn't make sense for work that's inherently iterative. You pay for the time we spend, and we're transparent about where it goes.

## Is this a fit?

Softpath works best with companies that have traction but can't trust their numbers. You have customers, you're spending on acquisition, but you suspect you're leaving money on the table because your measurement is broken or your tools don't work together.

Not a fit if you're pre-product-market-fit, need a full-service agency for creative production, or want someone to "just run the ads" without caring about measurement.

If you're unsure, [let's talk](/contact). A 30-minute conversation will tell us both whether there's something here.
