## Who's behind Softpath

Noah Manion founded Softpath after 13+ years watching the same pattern repeat: companies hire for paid acquisition or analytics, but the real problem is upstream. Tracking is broken. Tools don't talk to each other. Dashboard data doesn't match CRM data doesn't match ad platform data. Nobody trusts the numbers.

The pattern was always the same. Companies would bring Noah in to scale Meta or fix their LTV model, and within two weeks it became clear the infrastructure was the blocker. Events firing multiple times. Attribution windows misconfigured. Subscription billing platforms not integrated with analytics. Entire growth strategies built on numbers that didn't reflect reality.

Softpath exists to fix that first. We audit the infrastructure, get the measurement right, then help you scale acquisition with confidence. No more flying blind. No more hoping your $100K monthly Meta spend is actually working.

Beyond client work, Noah builds software tools that fill gaps in the growth stack. <a href="https://cadence.softpath.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cadence</a> helps teams plan and track growth experiments without drowning in spreadsheets. <a href="https://timeblock.softpath.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timeblock</a> is a custom day planner built because existing calendar tools don't understand how growth work actually happens.
