  <h1>I fix marketing infrastructure and run paid acquisition you can actually measure.</h1>
  <p class="lead">I'm Noah. I help B2C and B2B2C companies connect their ad spend to real business outcomes, not platform vanity metrics.</p>
  <p>Most growth teams are flying blind. Tracking is broken, tools don't talk to each other, and nobody trusts the numbers. I fix that, then help you scale paid acquisition with confidence.</p>
